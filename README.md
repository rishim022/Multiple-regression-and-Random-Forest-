# Multiple-regression-and-Random-Forest-
I have prepared a model using dataset from https://str.com/ and https://www.failteireland.ie/

Installation and Usage
I was not able to upload the .csv dataset as it is larger than 25MB. It is available as a .zip file from the str if requested from the mentioned link https://str.com/training/academic-resources/share-center. 
Install the requirements for this project in R and you will be ready to go.

Motivation
This is a something I have had developed and analysed during my Master's project. This is a prediction of the revenue in millions gained from the Tourism and Hospitality industry in Ireland.In the recent days Ireland has become the hubspot for all travel and has many beautiful locations which are visited by global travellers mainly the US, UK and the Middle East. This was a part of the whole analysis to predict the revenue and find correlations between the independent and the target variable.

Thank You.
